# Our goal today is to write a program (or just a method) that returns the total score
# for a game of bowling. We'll start with simple examples, but the rules can get quite
# confusing. The goal of the interview is to talk through decisions and dealing with
# new requirements.
#
# You very probably won't get through every example before time is done. That's expected.
#
# Any language is fine, as is either object oriented or procedural code.If you don't
# know the basics of how bowling works, you should ask up front.
